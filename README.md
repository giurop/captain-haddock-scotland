### 1. The Game
This game was inspired by the book 'The Adventures of Tintin - The Black Island' in which the main character ends up in Scotland to solve a mystery. In the original story, though, there's no mention of Captain Haddock who, in my humble opinion, would love to have been a part of this adventure in the whisky-land.

#### ii. Story

So, in this game, Captain Haddock has gone with Tintin back to Scotland to help Her Majesty the Queen to locate her precious crown that went missing. The action starts after they found the crown and are about to return it to her in the Edinburgh Castle but are ambushed by the same enemy they once met at the Black Island.

### 3. How to play:

With the arrow keys, move Captain Haddock through the castle grounds and press SPACE bar every time you get close to an enemy in order to attack it. It takes 3 hits to kill them. You should keep all enemies alway from Tintin and Snowy otherwise the game will be over. As Captain Haddock is very fond of whisky, you'll see quite often some bottles of whisky flying through the screen and you should try to grab it because it gives you extra strength when fighting the enemies. When drunk, only 1 hit is enough to kill them. On the other hand, water is no good for your health and cause you damage, so avoid it when you see the bottles coming your way. If you get hit by a bottle of water, you will lose a heart and if you lose all three hearts, the game is over. Fortunately the Lochness Monster (aka Nessie) do exist and is a good friend of yours, so sometimes you'll see her wandering the map and you should try to get to her, as she will give you an extra heart (if you already lost any). If you happen to survive for 30s, the game will automatically end and you will win!
